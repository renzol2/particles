A [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) particle simulation

In the summer before Fall 2020, I helped test out a new [Ideal Gas Simulation assignment](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs126/fa2020/assignments/ideal-gas/) for the [Software Design Studio (CS 126)](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs126/fa2020/) class at UIUC. While the code was written in C++, I'm rewriting it in JavaScript to put it on the web for others to enjoy! :)
